        Lymph node tissue pathological analysis is a common method used by doctors to evaluate the type and stage
         of breast cancer. Leveraging deep learning algorithms to detect
         lymph node metastases in breast cancer holds significant research
         potential. In this study, we propose a convolutional neural
         network (CNN) model for the automated classification of lymph
         nodes. The method is applied to PatchCamelyon (PCam) data
         set. Experimental results show good performance with F1 score
         of 0.8770 for the medical image classification and detection task.

          <p align="justify">
      
            With the advent of technologies like convolutional neural
 networks (CNNs), the classification of images has become
 a crucial aspect of machine learning. In the past, essential
 improvements have been facilitated by datasets like as MNIST,
 CIFAR, and SVHN. However, deep learning has emerged
 as a key component of medical imaging, particularly in the
 detection of metastases in histopathologic scans. The Camelyon16 [1] Challenge created the PatchCamelyon (PCam)
 dataset, which consists of 327,680 96x96 pixel color pictures
 annotated for tumor presence.
 Recent studies highlight the utility of CNNs in analyz
ing histopathological data, where models like ResNet and
 DenseNet have achieved state-of-the-art performance in tumor
 detection tasks by leveraging robust architectures and efficient
 optimization techniques [1], [2]. The use of batch normalization and adaptive optimizers, such as Adam, has further
 enhanced model convergence and stability, reducing overfitting
 risks [3], [4]. The dataset’s efficient gzipped HDF5 storage
 facilitates scalable training on single GPUs, making it a bench
mark for evaluating medical image analysis models [5]. The
 dataset offers metastasis identification as a binary classification
 task. In order to achieve dependable and efficient learning
 outcomes, this study aims to classify PCam pictures using
 CNNs by employing batch normalization, Adam optimization,
 and a balanced training-validation split and focuses mainly on
 recall and accuracy.

                  <b>A. Data Preparation:</b>
The PCam dataset, derived from the Camelyon16 Challenge, is designed for binary classification of histopathologic images to detect metastasis. The dataset initially contained 327,680 images (96x96 pixels), reduced to 277,516 unique samples by removing duplicates using MD5 hashing.

To address class imbalance (favoring non-malignant samples), a downsampling technique was applied, resulting in equal representation of classes:
<ul>
<li>Training set: 89,117 samples/class</li>
<li>Validation set: 11,722 samples/class</li>
<li>Test set: 12,994 samples/class</li>
</ul>

A manageable subset of 50,000 samples was created and split 8:1:1 into training (40,000), validation (5,000), and test (5,000) sets. These steps ensured a balanced, clean, and well-structured dataset for training.

                        Sample images (malignant in red, non-malignant in blue) highlighted subtle visual differences between classes, underscoring the complexity of classification.

<p><strong>Table I</strong> shows the performance of these models:</p>
<p align="justify">XGBoost achieved the highest performance among the classic models. However, due to its limitations in capturing complex spatial features, we moved forward to explore deep learning models.</p>

<h7><b>2) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</b></h7>

<p align="justify">We transitioned to CNNs because of their ability to learn spatial hierarchies of features from images. Our initial CNN experiment without data augmentation yielded the following performance:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> 85.98%</li>
    <li><strong>Precision:</strong> 0.900</li>
    <li><strong>Recall:</strong> 0.8006</li>
</ul>

<h7><b>3) CNN Depth Experiment</b></h7>

<p>To optimize the architecture, we experimented with different depths of the CNN:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>5-layer CNN:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Accuracy: 84.82%</li>
            <li>Precision: 0.9002</li>
            <li>Recall: 0.7832</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>10-layer CNN:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Accuracy: 80.92%</li>
            <li>Precision: 0.8888</li>
            <li>Recall: 0.7068</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>7-layer CNN</strong> offered the most balanced performance, improving recall without sacrificing precision or overall accuracy.</p>

<h7><b>4) Impact of Data Augmentation</b></h7>

<p>By applying data augmentation to the 7-layer CNN, we further improved recall, enhancing the model's robustness and generalization ability.</p>

<h7><b>5) Justification for Selecting CNN</b></h7>

<p>We selected the CNN as the primary model for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
    <li>It has a superior ability to capture spatial features in images.</li>
    <li>It significantly outperforms traditional machine learning models.</li>
    <li>The 7-layer architecture offers an optimal balance of complexity and performance.</li>
    <li>It has the potential for further improvements through data augmentation.</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">In conclusion, the 7-layer CNN with data augmentation emerged as the most suitable model, achieving superior performance in key metrics critical for medical image classification tasks.</p>

          <p align="justify">The CNN demonstrated strong performance, with a well-balanced set of metrics and particularly strong recall, which is crucial for minimizing false negatives in medical contexts. Based on these results, the CNN was selected as the final model due to its robust performance and ability to capture complex image features effectively.</p>
          <h5>Interpretability</h5>
          
          <h7><b>1) Early Convolutional Layers</b></h7>
          <p align="justify"><strong>Low-Level Feature Extraction:</strong> The initial layers capture fundamental features such as edges, textures, and simple patterns. These low-level characteristics help the model build an initial “map” of the image, which is essential for identifying structural differences between malignant and non-malignant areas.</p>
          <p align="justify"><strong>Importance for Prediction:</strong> By identifying edges and textures, these layers help the model distinguish cellular structures and basic textures, allowing it to recognize early indicators of malignancy.</p>
          
      

          <h7><b>3) Batch Normalization Layers</b></h7>
          <p align="justify"><strong>Normalization:</strong> Batch normalization layers standardize the outputs from the convolutional layers, stabilizing the learning process. This reduces the model’s sensitivity to variations in input data, which is particularly useful in medical imaging where conditions like lighting, staining, or tissue quality can vary.</p>
          
          <p align="justify"><strong>Generalization:</strong> Normalization helps the model generalize better across diverse datasets by making activations consistent, ensuring that each layer processes inputs on a similar scale. This contributes to reliable performance on unseen data and improves interpretability by making feature maps more stable and meaningful.</p>
          
          <h7><b>4) Pooling Layer (Downsampling)</b></h7>
          <p align="justify"><strong>Dimensionality Reduction:</strong> The pooling layer reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, focusing on prominent patterns while discarding finer, less critical details. This simplification helps retain essential features and reduces the computational load.</p>
          
          <p align="justify"><strong>Pattern Emphasis:</strong> After pooling, the model focuses on broader, more prominent patterns rather than fine-grained textures. These high-activation regions often correspond to significant structures or patterns in the image that could indicate malignancy, such as clusters of irregular cells.</p>
          
          <p align="justify"><strong>Regularization and Robustness:</strong> Pooling also serves as a regularizer, helping the model generalize better by making it less sensitive to small, irrelevant details or noise in the image. This is especially important in healthcare, where subtle differences in imaging conditions can lead to inconsistent predictions.</p>
          
          <h7><b>5) Hierarchical Understanding</b></h7>
          <p align="justify">The feature maps offer a window into how the CNN model builds a hierarchical understanding of the image. It starts by identifying low-level features in the early convolutional layers, moves through normalized representations, and finally focuses on high-level patterns through pooling. This hierarchical structure is essential for distinguishing between malignant and non-malignant samples and helps build trust in the model’s predictions, which is crucial for medical applications like cancer detection.</p>
          
          <h5>Conclusion</h5>
